# Q4ï¼šG-Research also has an inexplicable penchant for pi. The requirements are now
# such that if the number being tested, represented as a decimal's present in the
# first p digits of pi, also represented as a decimal and ignoring any decimal point,
# then"Pi" is emitted preferentially to Fizzes Buzzes or Prime. e.g. if p is 3 then
# we test against 314 and so 3,1,4,14,31 and 314 would all return "Pi".
