# Q1ï¼šEveryone has heard of "FizzBuzz". If you haven't: Google it. You are allowed
# to use the internet during this test. We'd like you to implement "FizzBuzz" please.
# Except at G-Research we often see the Pareto principle (or "80/20 rule") and
# generally believe in agile incremental delivery, so to make it easier we actually
# just want the Fizzes and not any Buzzes, please.
